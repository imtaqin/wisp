 *   2. Otherwise spawn a standalone server as a detached child and wait for it
 *      to bind. This keeps the shared-server model when the host can keep a
 *      detached child alive (e.g. a real `node` from a terminal or Claude Code).
 *      Skipped when no spawnDetached is provided.
 *   3. If that child never binds the port, host the server *inside this
 *      process* instead. This is the fix for issue #13 ("Unable to connect to
 *      extension server"): under hosts whose bundled Node runtime cannot keep a
 *      detached child alive (e.g. Claude Desktop), the spawned server silently
 *      never comes up, and the bridge used to give up with exit(1). Hosting
 *      in-process is guaranteed to work because the bridge itself is already
 *      running in a working Node runtime.
